# sign-language-prediction
sign language prediction model using sequential model is a type of machine learning algorithm that is designed to recognize and interpret sign language gestures. This model is based on a deep learning approach, specifically, a type of neural network called a recurrent neural network (RNN).

The sequential model is ideal for sign language recognition because sign language is a sequence of movements that convey meaning, and sequential models are able to capture the temporal dependencies between these movements. In this model, each sign is represented as a sequence of hand gestures and movements, which are fed into the RNN layer one at a time.

The RNN layer consists of a series of interconnected nodes, each of which maintains a "memory" of the previous inputs it has received. This allows the network to keep track of the sequence of movements and interpret them in context. The output of the RNN layer is then passed through one or more fully connected layers, which use this information to predict the corresponding sign.

Training a sign language prediction model using sequential model involves feeding the network a large dataset of sign language gestures, along with their corresponding labels. The network learns to recognize patterns in the data and adjusts its weights accordingly to improve its accuracy.

Once trained, the model can be used to recognize and interpret sign language gestures in real time, enabling communication between hearing-impaired and hearing individuals. This technology has the potential to break down communication barriers and improve accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
